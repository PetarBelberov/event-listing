## Event Listing
The Event Listing is an archive page that lists all events. Each event has a title, location (with Google map integration), event date, and a link to the external site. Also, the single event has an "Add to Google Calendar" button, which adds the event to the Google calendar.

## Installation
Clone the repository, and activate the plugin.

## Usage
The plugin would be ready to use when you open the "Events" post type in the dashboard and create your events. To show all the listed events just create a new page and copy the **[cpt_events]** slug in the Permalink URL box. There are few custom fields in the custom post type "Events"(location, event date, link to the external source/site). When you fill them, the single event will be visualized and ready to use.
