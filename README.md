## Event Listing
The Event Listing is a custom post type with an archive page that lists all events ordered by the event date picker field. Each event has a title, location (with Google map integration), event date, and a link to the external site. Also, the single event has an "Add to Google Calendar" button, which adds the event to the Google calendar.

## Installation
Clone the repository and activate the plugin.

## Usage
The plugin would be ready to use when you open the "Events" post type in the dashboard and create your events. To show all listed events, you can access the **/events** URI or add **[pb_event_listing]** shortcode wherever you want, and the events will be displayed. There are few custom fields in the custom post type "Events"(location, event date, link to the external source/site). When you fill them, the single event will visualize and ready to use.
